# fieldmove-notes-merger

This repository contains a Python 3 script **fieldmove_notes_merger.py** that merges and sorts .csv files created by the iOS app Fieldmove Clino, discards unnecessary fields, then outputs the result to a presentable LaTeX document.

Requirements:
* Python 3 and standard modules

Execution:
* open Terminal
* navigate to the directory in which **fieldmove_notes_merger.py** is saved
* execute 'python fieldmove_notes_merger.py'
* follow the prompts

Outputs:
* **all_notes.csv**
* **all_notes_filtered.csv**
* **latexoutput.tex**

All output files will be created in the same directory in which the Fieldmove .csvâ€™s are stored.
